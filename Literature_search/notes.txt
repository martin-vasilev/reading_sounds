- Participants were classified as adults only if they were >= 18 years
- Miller (1947) has reported correlations between the condition means
- I can use existing data (e.g. Hyona's experiment and mine) to approximate r
- Pay attention to the sign of extracted ES!!! Make sure they agree with the direction
  of the mean difference!
- Code ESs in a way that negative values indicate disruption of reading
- for # 39 ES are not completely independent as both TV conditions (different participants); # 42 is the same
  are compared to the silence group (same participants in both ESs). This needs to be
  considered.
