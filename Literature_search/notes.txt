- Participants were classified as adults only if they were >= 18 years
- Miller (1947) has reported correlations between the condition means
- I can use existing data (e.g. Hyona's experiment and mine) to approximate r
- Pay attention to the sign of extracted ES!!! Make sure they agree with the direction
  of the mean difference!
- Code ESs in a way that negative values indicate disruption of reading
- for # 39 ES are not completely independent as both TV conditions (different participants); # 42 is the same
  are compared to the silence group (same participants in both ESs). This needs to be
  considered.
- for reading speed, I may want to use opposite coding (e.g. - indicates slower reading) 
- Halin et al. (2014) JEP:A codes DV as percent misses. THIS NEEDS OPPOSITE ES CODING!!! (i.e. less misses is 
  better performance).
- make sure I include my first study 
- Papanikolaou et al. (2015): same confound with effect sizes
- Johnsson et al. (2012)- consider removing the condition where participants brought their own music (because this deviates 
  from remaining studies)
